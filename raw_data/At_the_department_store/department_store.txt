– That hat looks lovely with your coat.
– Yes, but I'm not sure if it matches the rest of my outfit.
– Perhaps you're right; maybe you should get it in a different color.
– No, I like the color and the style suits me. I think I'll buy a blouse to match the hat.
– Try this one, it's a designer label, but it's a bit more expensive but it goes so well with the style of the hat.
– Oh! It's beautiful. But I don't think I can afford it.
– We have a layaway plan if you're interested. We'll hold the item for you for up to 14 days.
– That would be wonderful! By then, I can save up the money.
