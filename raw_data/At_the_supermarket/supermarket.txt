– Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find
boxed oatmeal?
– That would be in aisle 2. Next to the bakery.
– Also, where can I find a shopping cart? My
basket is full.
– The shopping carts are by the exit, behind
the checkout counter.
– So I make a right at the grocery section and
go past the checkout?
– Yes, but you will have to leave your
purchases before the checkout while you go
get the shopping cart.
